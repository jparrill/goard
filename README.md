# Goard

The name comes from Guard, but it's done in Golang so, I think the name rocks.

This is just a fair attempt to avoid heart attacks from my son's ninja footsteps or maybe another situation when I need some focus and have my headset on with noise cancelling and my wife step into my home office (I'm not facing the door :D).

So Luxafor will help us here, if you wanna save some money you can do this easily with a Raspi-Zero and a led hat, here you have more info about how to deal with that, but here we will focus us on Luxafor.
